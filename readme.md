### Building a Balanced Binary Search Tree for an Odin Project Assignment

A follow-up to the linked list assignment, this continues the focus on exploring computer science concepts and data-handling. Here, I built a binary search tree which can be traversed using breadth-first search (level-order), depth-first search (pre/post/in-order search), have nodes added, deleted and searched with various other methods employed to explore the concept.

As well as being a follow-up to linked lists, this is a precursor to the Knights Travails project, where graph theory will be explored.
